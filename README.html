Spiceworks Celebrity New Hires

      Modify the included project to match the mockups. Feel free to use the included 3rd party libraries if they are useful to you but please don't add any others.
      Task: Create this page: mockups/initial.png     <!-- in mockups folder above -->

Details:
Only needs to work in the latest version of Chrome.
Things should line up and look symmetrical but please don't bother measuring. Just estimate heights, widths, padding etc.
After adding a new celebrity, page should look like this: mockups/after_addition.png

      Don't worry about persistence or AJAX or anything like that.
      Cards should occur in the order of addition with newest being at the top-left.
      Don't worry about form validation, the photo is optional.

The hover state for a card should look like this (top-left card): mockups/hover_state.png
After clicking the X as shown on hover, the card should be removed from the page, and the other cards should fall into place.
Photo URL can be to any image on the internet.

      Don't worry about proportionate scaling, just force it to a square.
      If no photo is provided, the default image (included) should be shown
